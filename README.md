my production function will take in a list of records and will asks the user what state they'd like to calculate the tax at. 
then it returns a float which I round and print out for the user

there is some error handling in the "select your state" loop that fairly robust for a nice user experience

currently, in order to test you need to open the project in an ied that supports testings and run the test manually
